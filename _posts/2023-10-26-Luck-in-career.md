#Lubar: lucky beyond all recognition

Luck plays a big and often unacknowledged part in career success, starting in the womb<sup> /wuːm/ </sup>. Warren Buffett has talked of winning the “ovarian<sup>/əʊˈveəriən/子房的</sup> lottery” by being born in America when he was, and being wired in a way that pays off in a market economy. Good looks are associated with higher pay and a greater chance of being called to interview in hiring processes. Your experience of discrimination<sup>/dɪˌskrɪmɪˈneɪʃn/</sup> will reflect your circumstances of birth.
>_Warren Buffett (1930–) a wealthy US businessman and investor (=someone who buys and sells stocks etc). He bought his first shares when he was 11, and bought land when he was 14, using the money he earned delivering newspapers. He studied at Columbia University after Harvard Business School said they would not take him. He is one of the world's richest people, but he has promised that he will give a lot of his money to charity._
>**pay off:** (informal) (of a plan or an action, especially one that involves risk尤指冒险的计划或行动) to be successful and bring good results成功；奏效；达到目的<br>
>>The gamble paid off.这一把赌对了      

>**discrimination：**[uncountable] the practice of treating somebody or a particular group in society less fairly than others区别对待；歧视；偏袒<br>

在职业成功的路上运气扮演着一个重要并且通常来说未认知的一部分，这种运气从出生就开始了。瓦伦·巴菲特曾在美国的时候谈起过“天赋符文”，具有适应市场经济的特质或天赋。你所受到的不公平对待将会映射你的出身环境。

The early way-stations<sup>落脚点</sup> in a career are often marked by chance: a particularly encouraging boss, say, or an assignment<sup>指派</sup> that leads you off in an unexpected but defining direction. Luck can affect the pathways of the most rational-minded professions. A paper published in 2022 by Qi Ge of Vassar College and Stephen Wu of Hamilton College found that economists with harder-to-pronounce names, including within ethnic groups, were less likely to be placed into academic jobs or get tenure<sup>/ˈten.jər/任期</sup>-track positions.
>waystation: a place where you can stop before going on somewhere else<br>

职业生涯的落脚点通常是靠机遇的：一个特别鼓励人心的老板，也或是一种指派，虽然没有领你去你想要的但是确是一个有决定性的方向。运气可以影响最理性的职业的发展路径.一份由Vassar大学的七哥和哈密尔顿大学的斯达棻联合发表的论文声称，那些具有难以发音的名字的经济学家或者团体，很少可能会被安排到学院工作或者任期。

Names can work against economists in other ways. Another study, by Liran Einav of Stanford University and Leeat Yariv, now of Princeton University, found that faculty with earlier surname initials were more likely to receive tenure at top departments, an effect they put down to the fact that authors of economics papers tend to be listed alphabetically.
>put down to sth:to consider that something is caused by something把…归因于<br>

名字会以其他不同的方式与经济学家作对。斯坦福大学利瑞安·艾因娜和丽埃特·雅瑞，目前隶属普林瑟顿大学，共同的研究表明，教师的名字的首字母靠前的会经常接收到顶级部门的受任邀请，这一影响被归因于经济学论文的作者通常按字母顺序列出

Performing well can be due to luck, not talent. In financial markets, asset managers who shine in one period often lose their lustre<sup>/ˈlʌstə(r)/光彩</sup> in the next. The rise of passive<sup>/ˈpæsɪv/被动的</sup> investing reflects the fact that few stockpickers are able persistently<sup>/pəˈsɪstəntli/固执地</sup> to outperform<sup>/ˌaʊtpəˈfɔːm/</sup> the overall market. The history of the oil industry is shot through with stories of unexpected discoveries. A recent paper by Alexei Milkov and William Navidi of the Colorado School of Mines found that 90% of industry practitioners believe that luck affects the outcome<sup>结果</sup> of exploration projects. The authors’ analysis of 50 years of drilling<sup>/ˈdrɪlɪŋ/①打孔②演习</sup> on the Norwegian<sup>/nɔːˈwiːdʒən/挪威的</sup> Continental Shelf concluded that the differences in success rates between individual firms were random.

表现好要归功于运气好，而不是天赋的原因。在金融市场，资产管理人在一段时间的风光之后便黯然失色。被动投资的崛起反映了很少有股票选取人能一再在整个市场当中风生水起。石油工业的历史随着始料不及的发现而褪去。最近的一项报告，该报告由科罗拉多矿井学校的 Alexei Milkov and William Navidi调查，发现90%的专业人员认为运气影响着勘探项目的结果。作者对近50年的挪威地壳钻取活动得出这样一个结论，在个体公司之间的成功概率是随机的。
AI:_表现出色可能归功于运气，而不是才能。在金融市场中，一些在某个时期表现出色的资产管理人往往在下一个时期失去了光彩。被动投资的兴起反映出很少有股票选择者能够坚持超越整个市场。石油工业的历史充满了关于意外发现的故事。科罗拉多矿业学校的Alexei Milkov和William Navidi最近的一份论文发现，90%的业内从业者认为运气影响了勘探项目的结果。作者对挪威大陆架50年的钻井活动进行的分析得出，个别公司的成功率差异是随机的。_
There is a long-running debate about whether luck affects executives’ pay. A recent paper by Martina Andreani and Lakshmanan Shivakumar of London Business School and Atif Ellahie of the University of Utah suggests that it does. The academics looked at the impact of a big corporate-tax cut in America in 2017, an event which resulted in large one-off<sup>一次性的</sup> tax gains and losses for firms that were based on past transactions and that could not be attributed to managers’ skills. They found that larger windfall gains led to higher pay for CEOs of less scrutinised<sup>/ˈskruːtənaɪz/细致审查</sup> firms; tax losses did not seem to affect their earnings. Lucky things.

>2017年是美国税收政策发生重大变化的一年，最重要的事件之一是通过了《美国税收减法与就业法案》（Tax Cuts and Jobs Act），这一法案经过国会批准并于2017年底由总统签署成为法律。以下是一些该法案的主要方面：
企业税率下调：该法案降低了公司所得税率，将公司所得税率从35%降至21%，旨在鼓励企业投资和增加就业机会。
个人所得税改革：该法案对个人所得税也进行了一些重大改革，包括调整税率和提高标准扣除额。这使得一些人的纳税负担减轻，但也有一些减税幅度较小的人。
支持孩子的税收优惠：法案增加了对有孩子的家庭的税收优惠，包括提高了儿童税收信用。
离岸资产税：该法案对跨国公司的海外资产征税，以鼓励资金回流美国。
离岸利润的纳税：法案实施了全球纳税制度，对美国公司在海外的利润征税。
这一税收法案引起了广泛的争议，一些人认为它促进了经济增长，而其他人则担心它可能会导致贫富差距的扩大。无论如何，它在2017年对美国税收政策产生了深远的影响。学者们研究了2017年美国一次大规模企业税收减少对企业的影响，

对于运气是否影响执行经历的薪水一直饱受争议。伦敦商学院的Martina Andreani和Lakshmanan Shivakumar以及犹他大学的Atif Ellahie最近的一份论文表明了这一点。这一事件导致了大规模的一次性税收收益和损失，这些税收收益和损失基于过去的交易，无法归因于管理人员的技能.他们发现，更大规模的意外获利导致了较少受到审查的公司的首席执行官薪酬增加.税收损失似乎并没有影响他们的个人所得。算他们的幸运吧！

Just as some people blindly believe that merit<sup>/ˈmerɪt/优点；美德；价值</sup> determines success, so it is possible to get too hung up on the role of chance. CEOs may well be rewarded for luck but slogging<sup>/ˈslɒɡɪŋ/埋头苦干</sup> to the top of companies involves talent and hard work. Although some have argued that entrepreneurs are simply people fortunate enough to have a large appetite for risk, skill does matter. A paper from 2006 by Paul Gompers of Harvard University and his co-authors showed that founders of one successful company have a higher chance of succeeding in their next venture than entrepreneurs who previously failed. Better technology and greater expertise reduce the role of chance; the average success rates in oil exploration, for example, have gone up over time.
就像一些人盲目的相信优点价值决定着成功，因此太过担心机遇扮演的角色也是可能的<sub>（过分强调机遇的作用也是可能的）</sub>执行经理也许会因为运气受到奖赏，但是达到一个公司的顶层阶级还是离不开天赋以及努力工作。虽然有些人认为企业家都是一些幸运儿，富贵险中求，但是不可忽略的是能力<sub>（尽管一些人认为企业家只是那些足够幸运且有很大风险承受能力的人，技能确实很重要）</sub>。2006年哈弗大学的保罗·宫坡和他的同事的一项报告表明，成功公司的建立者在后续的创业风险中会比那些有失败经历的企业家更有机会成功。更好的技术和专家减少了机遇的重要性，例如石油勘探的平均成功率，随着时间推移也有所提高。

But if luck does play a more important role in outcomes than is often acknowledged, what does that mean? For individuals, it suggests you should increase the chances that chance will work in your favour. Partners at Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, encourage founders to apply to their programmes<sup>(British English)</sup> by talking about increasing the “surface area of luck”: putting yourself in situations where you may be rejected is a way of giving luck more opportunity to strike.
但是如果运气在结果表现上扮演着比我们认知到的更重要的角色，那这意味着什么呢？对于个体而言，这表明我们应该提升对于我们自身有利的机遇。Y Combinator的合伙人鼓励创始人申请他们的项目，通过谈论增加“幸运的机会”来激励他们.将自己置于可能会被拒绝的情况中是增加幸运降临机会的一种方式
>_A startup accelerator is an organization or program that provides early-stage companies, known as startups, with various resources, support, and mentorship to help them grow and succeed. These programs typically offer a combination of funding, workspace, access to a network of experienced mentors and advisors, educational workshops, and other valuable resources._
>_The goal of a startup accelerator is to accelerate the growth and development of the participating startups. Startups often join these programs for a fixed period, commonly three to six months, during which they receive intensive support and guidance. In return, the accelerator program may take equity in the startup or charge a fee for their services._
>_Well-known startup accelerators include Y Combinator, Techstars, and 500 Startups, among others. They have played a significant role in the success of many tech companies and startups by providing them with the resources and guidance needed to navigate the challenges of the early stages of business development._

An awareness of the role that luck plays ought to affect the behaviour of managers, too. Portfolio thinking reduces the role of luck: Messrs Milkov and Navidi make the point that the probability of striking it lucky in oil exploration goes up if firms complete numerous independent wells. If luck can mean a bad decision has a good result, or vice versa<sup>/ˌvaɪs ˈvɜːsə/[拉丁语]反之亦然，反过来也是一样 [略作 v.v.]</sup>, managers should learn to assess<sup>/əˈses/评估</sup> the success of an initiative on the basis of process as well as outcome.
对运气扮演的角色有多少认识和理解也会影响管理人员的表现。巴特弗里奥认为减少运气的成分：Messrs Milkov and Navidi指出了重要的一点，即石油勘探的成功率的提高是建立在无数的依靠运气而成功的独立矿井才做到今天这样的结果。如果运气指是不好的决定带来好的结果，反之亦然，那么管理人员应该学会评估基于过程和结果的举措的成功。

And if the difference between skill and luck becomes discernible<sup>/dɪˈsɜːnəbl/可分辨得</sup> over time, then reward people on consistency of performance, not one-off highs. Mr Buffett might have had a slice of luck at the outset<sup>开始</sup>, but a lifetime of investing success suggests he has maximised it.■
如果技能和运气之间的不同随着时间的推移变得清晰可辨,有迹可循,那么回馈给你得便是一贯得表现结果,不是一次性得达到得高度.巴菲特先生最开始的时候也许是有一丝幸运的成分,但是一生的成功投资说明他已经令自己的幸运最大化了.
