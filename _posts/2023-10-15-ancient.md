Want to know what is coming soon to a cinema near you? Probably not an hour-and-a-half-long movie, like the old days. This year audiences have endured the longest instalments yet in the [“Indiana Jones<sup>夺宝奇兵：命运转盘</sup>”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/06/29/the-secrets-of-indiana-jones), “John Wick” and “Mission: Impossible<sup>碟中谍</sup> ” franchises<sup>/ˈfræntʃaɪz/[countable] a set of films in which the same characters appear in related stories<sup><sup>Disney has successfully revived the ‘Star Wars’ franchise, with four films already released and more in the works.迪士尼已经成功恢复了《星球大战》的专营权，已经发行了四部电影，并且还有更多作品正在制作中</sup> .

[“Oppenheimer”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie), Christopher Nolan’s three-hour blockbuster<sup>/ˈblɒkbʌstə(r)/</sup><sup><sup>(informal)something very successful, especially a very successful book or film一鸣惊人的事物；（尤指）非常成功的书（或电影）</sup></sup>, required 11 miles (18km) of film stock for IMAX showings.

On October 20th comes “Killers of the Flower Moon<sup>花月杀手</sup>” , a grisly<sup>/ˈɡrɪzli/<sup>extremely unpleasant and frightening and usually connected with death and violence令人厌恶的；恐怖的；可怕的</sup></sup> western from the director Martin Scorsese. At nearly three and a half hours, its length is nearly double the average film last year. Even film buffs<sup>/bʌf/<sup>[countable] (used in compounds用于构成复合词) a person who is very interested in a particular subject or activity and knows a lot about it爱好者；行家里手<sup><sup>a film/movie/history buff电影/电影/历史爱好者</sup></sup></sup> struggle<sup>/ˈstrʌɡl/<sup></sup>to try very hard to do something when it is difficult or when there are a lot of problems奋斗；努力；争取</sup> to concentrate for that long. During the premiere at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/30/anatomy-of-a-fall-a-riveting-whodunnit-wins-at-cannes) in May, some viewers dozed off. Afterwards there was a mad dash (and long queue) for the toilets. When did watching a film become such a slog<sup>/slɒɡ/a period of hard work or effort一段时间的艰苦工作（或努力）</sup>?

*The Economist* analysed over 100,000 feature films released internationally since the 1930s, the start of Hollywood’s golden age, using data from IMDb, a movie database. The average length of productions has crept<sup>/krept/</sup> up by around 24%, from one hour and 21 minutes in the 1930s to one hour and 47 minutes in 2022 (see chart). Blockbusters are the worst offenders. For the ten most-popular titles (measured by how many reviewers rated the films on IMDb) average lengths stretched to around two and a half hours in 2022, nearly 50% higher than in the 1930s.

Film-makers began churning<sup>verb./tʃɜːn/[intransitive, transitive] if water, mud, etc. churns, or if something churns it (up), it moves or is moved around violently剧烈搅动；（使）猛烈翻腾</sup> out protracted<sup>/prəˈtræktɪd/延长的，拖延的</sup> pictures in the early 1960s. Cinema was booming and auteurs<sup>/əʊˈtɜː(r)/主创导演</sup> wanted to distinguish their art from television. Epics graced the silver screen, including [“Lawrence of Arabia”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/04/28/prince-of-his-disorder) (1962), which surpassed the three-and-a-half hour mark, and [“Cleopatra”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/10/a-new-docu-drama-about-cleopatra-has-riled-officials-in-cairo) (1963), which originally exceeded four hours but was later cut down. Back then, cinéastes enjoyed an intermission while the projectionist prepared the reels for the next act. Runtimes of popular films ebbed and flowed over subsequent decades (and stretched long in some countries, such as India, known for its Bollywood sagas). But they have ballooned since 2018.
>**churn out粗制滥造出**
>churn out sth • churn sth out to quickly produce large quantities of something, especially without caring about quality:
In recent years, large corporations have built overseas factories to churn out clothing and toys.
She used to churn out at least one novel each year.

Franchises are one driver of this trend. Studios want to squeeze the most out of their costly intellectual property, but they are competing with streaming platforms for eyeballs. The hope is that a spectacular, drawn-out “event” movie will tempt audiences away from the small screen and into cinemas. This approach has often paid off: [“Avengers: Endgame”](https://www.economist.com/search?q=avengers+endgame) (2019), Marvel’s three-hour superhero extravaganza, is the second-highest-grossing film in history. In 2022 lengthy franchises made up many of the most successful films in America.

Anything that lures people off their couches to see a film in theatres is good news for cinemas. But protracted runtimes also pose a “fundamental problem”, complains Clare Binns, managing director of Picturehouse, a British cinema group and film distributor. Long movies can mean forgoing two showings per night, which hurts ticket sales and profits.

Another explanation for longer films has to do with directors’ growing clout. Who would dare tell the likes of Mr Nolan to trim his masterpieces? Streamers, which do not have to worry as much about concision because viewers can pause whenever they would like, may lure big names with deep pockets and promises of creative freedom. “Killers of the Flower Moon” will debut on AppleTV+ after its theatrical run. Netflix funded and released Mr Scorsese’s equally long [“The Irishman”](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/10/31/the-irishman-is-an-engrossing-and-gloriously-funny-gangster-epic) in 2019, a film that would have benefited from a decisive editor, Irish or otherwise. ■
