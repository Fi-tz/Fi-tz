## The creamy tipple inspired a riot in the 19th century

TO THE CADETS at West Point, the prospect of eggnog<sup>/ˈeɡnɒɡ/蛋奶酒</sup> without whisky was unconscionable<sup>/ʌnˈkɒn.ʃən.ə.bl̩/违背良心的</sup>. Flouting<sup>/ˈflaʊtɪŋ/公然藐视，无视（法律等）</sup> a ban on alcohol, a group took a boat across the Hudson river and procured<sup>/prəˈkjʊəd/（设法）获得</sup> gallons of grog<sup>/ɡrɒɡ/</sup>. Around 90 cadets got so drunk that they spent Christmas morning smashing windows and flashing their weapons. Among the participants in the “Eggnog Riot” of 1826 was Jefferson Davis, who later became president of the Confederacy<sup>/kənˈfedərəsi/</sup>.
>Hudson river<sup>哈得孙河</sup>:a river in New York State in the US, which meets the Atlantic Ocean in New York City. The Hudson is named after the explorer, Henry Hudson.

Eggnog is a sweet beverage<sup> /ˈbev.ər.ɪdʒ/ </sup> with a serious edge. It is probably derived<sup>/dɪˈraɪvd/</sup> from “posset<sup>/ˈpɒsɪt/牛奶甜酒</sup>”—a concoction<sup>/kənˈkɒkʃn/（古怪或少见的）混合物</sup> involving a combination of cream or milk, eggs, spices and ale<sup>/eɪl/麦芽啤酒</sup> or wine. Posset was believed to have medicinal<sup>/məˈdɪs.ɪ.nəl/有疗效的</sup> properties: when King Charles I came down with a cold in the 1600s, his physician<sup>/fɪˈzɪʃn/</sup> prescribed<sup>/prɪˈskraɪb/</sup> it.

The annual flu probably established the drink’s association with winter. But Christmas has also given eggnog a boost. The spices used—cinnamon<sup>/ˈsɪnəmən/肉桂皮</sup>, cloves<sup>/kləʊv/丁香</sup> and nutmeg<sup>/ˈnʌtmeɡ/肉豆蔻（尤用作调味料）</sup>—are present in other festive treats, such as gingerbread. For centuries cream and fresh eggs were harder to acquire in winter, so were viewed as luxuries.

Britons brought the drink to America in the 18th century. Fortified<sup>/ˈfɔːtɪfaɪd/（加入某物）强化（食品或饮料）；提高（营养价值）</sup> wine, traditionally used to spike posset, was difficult to obtain, so Americans laced their version with bourbon, rum or whisky instead. Though eggnog is consumed in many English-speaking countries, Americans are the most keen on it. They consume around 15m gallons every year, the equivalent of one small cup per person. (Some “eggheads”, no doubt, guzzle more.<sub>毫无疑问，一些“书呆子”的饮酒量更大</sub>)

Many countries have added their own twist. Germans make Eierpunsch with wine. Peruvians<sup>/pəˈruːviən/秘鲁人</sup> add pisco<sup>皮斯科白兰地(一种秘鲁白兰地酒)</sup>, a white brandy; South Africans opt for amarula, a liqueur. Eggnog has also been adapted for a health-conscious age. Vegans<sup>/ˈviːɡən/严格素食主义者</sup> can forgo eggs and use almond<sup>/ˈɑːmənd/扁桃仁</sup>, coconut<sup>椰子</sup> or oat<sup>/əʊt/燕麦制的；含燕麦的</sup> milk, which is less fatty; a single portion of the original can exceed 300 calories (admittedly a trifling<sup>/ˈtraɪflɪŋ/微不足道的</sup> sum compared with the roughly 6,000 calories the average Briton consumes on Christmas Day)<sub>一份原味可超过 300 卡路里（诚然，与英国人在圣诞节平均消耗的约 6,000 卡路里相比，这个数字微不足道）</sub>.
>Eierpunsch (lit. 'egg punch') is the German name given to a warm, sweetened alcoholic, egg-based drink similar to eggnog.<br>
>amarula:A cream liquor made in South Africa from an exotic fruit tree called the marula tree.<br>

Its creaminess is a reminder of the comforts of childhood, while the addition of booze is a grown-up pleasure. Unlike mulled<sup>/mʌld/（指葡萄酒）放入糖和香料加热过的</sup> wine, eggnog is often served chilled, so none of the alcohol evaporates<sup>/ɪˈvæpəreɪt/（使）蒸发，挥发</sup>. A recipe attributed to George Washington could take down an elephant: he called for adding brandy, rum, sherry<sup>/ˈʃeri/雪利酒（烈性葡萄酒，原产自西班牙南部）</sup> and whisky.

The stupefying effect of eggnog was known long before the riot that bears its name.<sub>蛋酒的令人昏昏欲睡的效果在它得名的暴动之前就已经为人所知</sub> In Shakespeare’s<sup> /ˈʃeɪkspɪə/莎士比亚</sup> play, the murderous Lady Macbeth drugs the servants’ posset in order to gain access to the king’s bedroom: “That which hath<sup>/hæθ/(old use)has</sup> made them drunk hath made me bold.”

Today the drink is associated with less serious crimes, namely tipsiness<sup>/ˈtɪp.sinəs/Drunkenness and sobriety</sup> at holiday parties. A poem published in the American Beacon on Christmas Eve in 1817 evoked ancient Greek mythology to suggest that the drink turned respectable people into beasts: 
“When Circe, the witch, caught Ulysses’s men<sub>当女巫瑟西抓住尤利西斯的人时</sub>
She gave each a dram <sub>她给每个人一小杯</sub>
that soon made him a hog，<sub>很快就把他变成了猪</sub>
The identical mixture—’tis now as ’twas then<sub>同样的混合物，现在依然如此</sub>
So attend to the moral<sub>因此请注意这个寓言</sub> 
Beware of eggnog.” <sub>小心蛋酒</sub>
