### How Ted Lasso killed Tony Soprano
>Ted Lasso:《足球教练》是一部美国体育喜剧剧情网络电视，由杰森·苏戴西斯、比尔·劳伦斯、布兰登·杭特、乔·凯利（Joe Kelly）开发，基于杰森·苏戴西斯在NBC体育报道英超联赛的一系列宣传片中首次塑造的同名角色

>Tony Soprano:安东尼·约翰·索普拉诺 (Anthony John Soprano) 是一个虚构人物，也是 HBO 犯罪电视剧《黑道家族》的主角，由詹姆斯·甘多菲尼饰演。

“Shh, it’s ok,” whispers Frank Underwood (played by Kevin Spacey), as he strokes<sup>/strəʊks/<sup>n.一击，中风；v.轻抚</sup></sup> an injured dog just hit by a car. As the dog whimpers<sup>/ˈwɪmpəz/抽泣</sup>, he soothes it—then, after looking the viewer directly in the eye, wrings<sup>/rɪŋz/</sup> its neck.

>Frank Underwood:弗朗西斯·约瑟夫·安德伍德（英语：Francis Joseph Underwood，1959年11月5日—2017年5月），是美国演员凯文·史派西在Netflix改编剧《纸牌屋》中饰演的虚构人物

>Kevin Spacey:凯文·史派西·福勒 2017年10月30日，演员安东尼·瑞普公开指责凯文·史派西在他14岁时意图性侵他。在安东尼·瑞普的指控之后，许多其他男子也宣称凯文·史派西试图强奸或对他们使用暴力。由于凯文·史派西的丑闻爆发，Netflix在审判前已经有罪推定原则下，宣布无限期暂停《纸牌屋》新一季的制作；同时也宣布将终止发行与其联合制作的传记片《戈尔》，据悉该片目前已经进入到后期制作。史派西否认了这些指控，并在2022年纽约的诉讼和2023年伦敦的诉讼中洗脱了所有指控。

Not so long ago this scene, which launched Netflix’s “House of Cards” in 2013, would have been unshowable on American television. Broadcasters were bound<sup>/baʊnd/</sup> by federal rules against rude or racy<sup>/ˈreɪsi/</sup> content and cowed<sup>/kaʊd/使感到胆怯的；自惭形秽的</sup> by advertisers who demanded wholesome heroes and happy endings. But in the 21st century bad guys have had a good run. The amoral<sup>/ˌeɪˈmɒrəl/</sup> Congressman (later President) Underwood, the violent mobster<sup>/ˈmɒb.stər/gangster</sup> Tony Soprano<sup>安东尼·约翰·索普拉诺 (Anthony John Soprano) 是一个虚构人物，也是 HBO 犯罪电视剧《黑道家族》的主角，由詹姆斯·甘多菲尼饰演</sup>, the cocaine-smuggling Pablo Escobar<sup>柏保路·艾斯高巴,哥伦比亚毒枭</sup> of “Narcos电视剧毒枭” and the megalomaniac<sup>/ˌmeɡələˈmeɪniæk/渴望权力；权欲熏心</sup> media baron Logan Roy<sup>《继承之战》里面的爹罗根·洛伊</sup> have lit up the small screen, in what critics have hailed as a golden era for television. As viewers migrated from broadcast channels to cable, and then to streaming, shows became darker and more daring.
>bound<sup>/baʊnd/</sup>: forced to do something by law, duty or a particular situation受（法律、义务或情况）约束（必须做某事）；有义务（做某事<br>

Yet today, the TV business is in flux once more—and so is the nature of its output. Insurgent<sup>/ɪnˈsɜːdʒənt/起义者</sup> streamers have settled in as cosy incumbents<sup>/ɪnˈkʌmbənt/在职者；现任者</sup>. Big tech firms are using streaming to promote their other products. The upshot<sup>/ði ˈʌpʃɒt/结果</sup>, argues Peter Biskind in “Pandora’s Box”, a binge-worthy book about TV’s recent history, is that the risky, rule-breaking shows that defined television in the early 21st century are giving way to less original fare.<sub>Peter Biskind 在他的书《Pandora's Box》中提到，关于电视近期历史的这本值得一看的书，他认为，在21世纪初期定义电视的冒险、突破规则的节目正在让位于更缺乏原创性的内容</sub>

>Peter Biskind (born 1940) is an American cultural critic, film historian, journalist and former executive editor of Premiere magazine from 1986 to 1996.
Mr Biskind, a cultural critic, traces TV’s recent golden era to the launch in 1972 of Home Box Office (HBO), a cable network. With its focus on boxing matches and cheap thrills—“G-String Divas<sup>丁字裤女主</sup>”, “Taxicab Confessions<sup>出租车的自白</sup>” and so on—HBO was initially known for “fighting and fondling”. But then it began to commission original drama series and ventured where broadcast television could not.

HBO and other cable networks could ignore the nannying<sup>/ˈnæniɪŋ/</sup> rules that constrained broadcasters. And their subscription fees meant no ads, and therefore no jittery<sup>/ˈdʒɪtəri/紧张不安的</sup> advertisers demanding bland<sup>/blænd/平淡的；乏味的</sup>, brand-safe content. Writers relished<sup>/ˈrelɪʃ/享受</sup> this freedom. “The things I’m getting away with, I should be arrested for,” said a writer on “Oz<sup>监狱风云</sup>”, a boundary-pushing HBO prison drama whose plotlines included an inmate<sup>/ˈɪnmeɪt/同住者；同狱犯</sup> having a swastika<sup>/ˈswɒstɪkə/卍</sup> burnt onto his bottom with a cigarette. Bossy advertisers got short shrift. When executives at AMC, another cable network, tried to arrange a product placement for Jack Daniel’s whisky in “Mad Men<sup>广告狂人</sup>”, a writer responded: “If you want me to work this thing into the show, I’m going to have it sterilising<sup>/ˈsterəlaɪzɪŋ/灭菌；消毒</sup> equipment in the back alley<sup>/ˈæli/小巷，胡同</sup> of an abortionist clinic.”

The new television was not just about shock. Cable allowed writers to make shows more sophisticated. As David Chase, the creator of “The Sopranos”, put it: “On network, everybody says exactly what they’re thinking at all times. I wanted my characters to be telling lies.” Since cable aired episodes repeatedly, writers could assume that viewers were up to date, meaning that story arcs<sup>/ɑːk/作弧形运动</sup> could last whole seasons rather than being crammed<sup>/kræmd/塞满的；挤满的</sup> into self-contained episodes. This attracted star directors and actors to try out the small screen, including Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who made “Band of Brothers” for HBO in 2001. In drama, “The beginning is inevitable, the end is inevitable, but the middle is not so inevitable, and television is about the middle,” says Brian Cox, who played Logan Roy in HBO’s “Succession”.

Streaming took what cable started and pushed it further. Making whole seasons available on demand has allowed viewers to binge<sup>/bɪndʒ/（短时间的）狂热活动</sup>, reviving the importance of plot, which had been subordinated<sup>/səˈbɔːdɪneɪtɪd/把…置于次要地位,使从属于</sup> to character in shows like “The Sopranos”. With past episodes fresh in the viewer’s mind, less plodding<sup>/ˈplɒdɪŋ/老牛拖破车似的；做事慎重而呆板的</sup> exposition<sup>/ˌekspəˈzɪʃn/（理论、计划等的）解释，说明，阐述</sup> is needed. Streamers’ offering of thousands of shows at once has also enabled niches<sup>/niːʃ/, /nɪtʃ/</sup> to thrive. Streaming has found a home for ideas that were too daring, weird or obscure even for cable, from Korean horror to Swedish romance. As Reed Hastings, Netflix’s co-founder, put it, “We are to cable networks as cable networks were to broadcast networks.”

>niche:
>①a comfortable or suitable role, job, way of life, etc.舒适或称心的工作（或生活等）<br>
>②(business商业) a small section of the market for a particular kind of product or service“利基”，商机，市场补缺（针对特定消费者群体的市场需求）
>They spotted a niche in the market, with no serious competition.他们在市场上发现了一个竞争不大的商机<br>
>流媒体继承了有线电视的先河，并将其推得更远。按需提供整季节目让观众可以尽情观看，重新认识了情节的重要性，而在《黑道家族》等节目中，情节一直服从于角色。由于观众对过去的情节记忆犹新，因此不需要那么乏味的阐述。流媒体同时提供数千个节目也使得利基市场蓬勃发展。从韩国恐怖到瑞典浪漫，流媒体为即使对于有线电视来说也过于大胆、怪异或晦涩的想法找到了归宿。正如 Netflix 联合创始人里德·黑斯廷斯 (Reed Hastings) 所说，“我们之于有线网络，就像有线网络之于广播网络一样。”

Today Hollywood is in flux<sup>/flʌks/不断的变动</sup> once more—and its output is evolving, too. Six months of strikes by writers and actors have halted production this year. (Writers have gone back to work, but not actors.) Even before that, studios were preparing to cut back, as investors began to demand evidence of profits rather than just subscriber growth.<sub>在那之前，电影公司就已经开始准备削减，因为投资者开始要求证明利润，而不仅仅是关注订阅增长</sub> In America more than 2,000 original series were released last year (see chart). This will probably be the high-water mark, believes John Landgraf, chairman of the FX cable network.

### The upcoming season

As the quantity of new shows falls, some believe the quality is diminishing, too. Several studios have been plagued<sup>/pleɪɡd/给…造成长时间的痛苦（或麻烦）；困扰；折磨；使受煎熬</sup> by real-life drama: from 2018, HBO endured four unhappy years of ownership by AT&T<sup>American Telephone and Telegraph</sup>, a phone company that knew little about TV. (Its boss suggested producing “Game of Thrones” in 20-minute episodes to be mobile-friendly.) Across the industry, a shift is under way. Mr Biskind quotes writers and actors who complain that streamers are returning to the safe centre ground that broadcast networks used to occupy.<sub>比斯金先生引用了一些作家和演员的抱怨，称流媒体平台正在回归到广播网络过去占据的安全中心地带。</sub> “I want to do in-your-face shit,” says Kenya Barris, the creator of inventive shows such as “Black-ish”. But “Netflix wants down-the-middle…Netflix became CBS.”<sub>肯尼亚·巴里斯，创造了《黑人大不同》等创新节目的创作者说：“我想做大胆的东西，”但是“Netflix想要的是平庸之作……Netflix变成了CBS。</sub>

>in-your-face :used to describe an attitude, a performance, etc. that is aggressive in style and deliberately designed to make people react strongly for or against it（态度、表演等）赤裸裸的，富有刺激性的，有意惹人发怒的

>down-the-middle:平庸<br>

Advertising has made a comeback, as streamers try to squeeze more dollars out of more subscribers. And bingeing is being reined in. Most streamers now release new shows weekly to keep subscribers on board for longer. Even Netflix, the pioneer of bingeing, is moving this way, dripping out episodes of some new shows one by one.

>rein in
1. rein in/back sth • rein sth in/back to reduce something or stop it increasing, especially the amount of money spend by a government or company:<br>
the failure of the government to rein in public spending<br>

If the company reins back its expenditure on research and development jobs will have to go.<br>

With hundreds of millions of subscribers, the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have bigger audiences than any broadcaster. As they grow, streamers seem to be edging away from niches and towards the mainstream. One example is sport. Amazon has shelled out<sup>to pay money (out). (Slang)</sup> for the rights to American football, while Netflix will air<sup>播出；播送</sup> its first live sporting event (a celebrity golf tournament<sup>锦标赛；联赛</sup>) in November. Streamers and cable firms are also developing a dependence on franchises<sup>（公司授予的）特许经销权；（国家授予的）特别经营权</sup> and sequels<sup>/ˈsiːkwəl/（书、电影、戏剧等的）续篇，续集</sup> that has been a feature of the box office for years.<sup>“流媒体和有线公司也正在培养对多部曲和续集的依赖，这在电影票房中已经存在多年。”</sup> HBO, which long resisted the tide of spin-offs<sup>（意外但有用的）副产品，派生物</sup>, reboots and prequels, has recently released adaptations including a “Sex and the City” reboot and multiple “Game of Thrones” spin-offs, including animations and a stage play.

It is hardly surprising that studios are leaning on franchises during hard times: they are safe bets, argues Walt Hickey in “You Are What You Watch”, a chart-filled tour through the entertainment business.<sup>这并不令人意外，影视公司在艰难时期依赖系列作品：在《You Are What You Watch》一书中，瓦特·希基(Walt Hickey)提出这是一种安全的选择，这本书通过丰富的图表对娱乐业进行了全面的解析</sup> Mr Hickey, a data journalist at Insider, calculates that since 1980 the average movie sequel has made 4.2 times its budget at the box office, while the equivalent figure for original works is 2.8 times.

Perhaps the biggest drivers of the move to the mainstream are the tech titans getting into streaming. Both Apple TV+ and Amazon will survive the financially ruinous streaming wars. (They will “hold everybody’s head under water until they drown<sup>/draʊn/</sup>,” Steven Soderbergh, a star film-director, tells Mr Biskind.) But Amazon and Apple see streaming as a way to bolster<sup>/ˈbəʊlstə(r)/</sup> audiences’ interest in their other businesses. As Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, once said, to groans in Hollywood: “When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes.”

The result is that their output is resolutely<sup>/ˈrezəluːtli/in a way that shows great purpose</sup> brand-safe. Rather than the “nudity, raw language and violence” on other streamers, Apple wants to make shows with “broad appeal<sup>恳求、感染力、上诉</sup>”, Tim Cook, the company’s boss, has said. This leads to shows like “Ted Lasso<sup>《足球教练》是一部美国体育喜剧剧情网络电视</sup>”—a “sunshine enema<sup>/ˈenəmə/灌肠剂；（尤指手术前的）灌肠</sup>”, in the words of one of its producers—and “The Morning Show”, which debuted as a hard-hitting drama about the toxic culture of a broadcast-news network but has degenerated into a mindless soap opera.<sub>这导致了像《Ted Lasso》这样的节目——正如其中一位制片人所说的，“阳光灌肠”——以及《The Morning Show》，它最初是一部关于广播新闻网络有毒文化的震撼剧，但已经演变成了一部毫无深度的肥皂剧。<sub> Amazon, whose early TV commissioning was more daring, now also focuses on the middle ground, with series such as “Citadel<sup>/ˈsɪtədəl/</sup>”, a big-budget, low-imagination thriller with plenty of explosions and no surprises.

There are some subjects where the globe-spanning<sup>/ˈspænɪŋ/横跨；跨越</sup> tech titans are even touchier<sup>/ˈtʌtʃi/敏感性的；需要小心处理的；棘手的</sup> than the old broadcast networks. Apple recently cancelled “The Problem with Jon Stewart”, a satirical<sup>/səˈtɪrɪkl/using satire to criticize somebody/something讽刺的；讥讽的</sup> current-affairs show, reportedly because of concerns about Mr Stewart’s critical stances<sup>/stæns立场、观点</sup> on China and artificial intelligence.

Some of the people who helped to create TV’s golden age are downbeat<sup>/ˈdaʊnbiːt/沉闷的；令人沮丧的；悲观的</sup> about its future. HBO “died at 50”, Michael Fuchs, who ran the network in the 1980s, tells Mr Biskind.<sub>HBO“在50岁时就结束了”，迈克尔·富克斯（Michael Fuchs）告诉比斯金德先生。</sub> “There’s no longer an HBO.” A producer of “The Wire”, one of HBO’s grittiest<sup>逼真的 活生生的</sup> and most celebrated shows, says the company would never make it today. For creatives, television’s golden age is turning into a gilded<sup> /ˈɡɪl.dɪd/covered with a thin layer of gold or gold paint镀金的；涂金色的</sup> cage. <sub>一位制作《The Wire》的制片人，这是HBO最真实且备受赞誉的剧集之一，表示公司如今不可能再制作这样的节目。对于创作者而言，电视的黄金时代正在变成一个镀金的囚笼</sub>■
