## That hardly matters. It will change how history is seen anyway

Few series have had the ability to irritate<sup>引起不愉快,引起恼怒</sup> audiences as reliably as Netflix’s “The Crown”, whose sixth and final season will be released on November 16th. There has been affection, too: at least 73m viewers worldwide, critical acclaim, a glitter of awards and whatnot.<sub>也有感情：至少有7300万全球观众，广受好评，获得一系列奖项和其他种种光辉</sub> But irritation reigns. The series has been criticised for its portrayal<sup>/pɔːˈtreɪ-əl/描绘</sup> of Prince Charles (too scheming<sup>/ˈskiː.mɪŋ/阴谋</sup>), the Queen Mother (too nasty<sup>龌龊的</sup>) and the Duke of Windsor (too Nazi). It has been called “crude<sup>天然的, 未加工的; 未提炼的</sup>”, “cruel”, “intrusive”, “impertinent<sup>粗鲁无礼的；不敬的</sup>” and several sorts of nonsense, including pure “nonsense”, “nonsense on stilts”, and “a barrel-load of nonsense”. Rumours that this season will feature Princess Diana’s ghost led one historian to call it “farcical<sup>/ˈfɑː.sɪ.kəl/闹剧(或笑剧)的</sup>—just a sick joke”.

There are two ways to look at “The Crown”. One is as soap opera with added sceptres<sup>/ˈsep.tər/权杖，节杖</sup>, a royally expensive royal drama.<sub>一出极其昂贵的皇室戏剧</sub> (It was rumoured to be Netflix’s costliest show yet.) The other is to see it as an excellent if impromptu<sup> /ɪmˈprɒmp.tʃuː/即兴地, 即席地</sup> education in what history is and what it is not—a historiographical triumph if not a historical one.<sub>另一种看法是将其视为一次出色但即兴的历史教育，它解释了历史的实质和非实质——虽然不是历史上的胜利，但在史学上却是一次成功。</sub> Millions who hitherto<sup>/ˌhɪð.əˈtuː/到目前为止, 迄今</sup> might never have wondered how the sausage of history is formed from the raw meat of the past are, with each successive season, turned into amateur<sup>/ˈæmətə(r)/业余的</sup> historical analysts, as they google primary sources, fact-check phrases and scrutinise<sup>/ˈskruːtənaɪz/细致审查</sup> photographs. Again and again, the same question is asked: is this history?
>if :used before an adjective to introduce a contrast（置于形容词之前，引出对比）虽然，尽管<br>
>He's a good driver, if a little over-confident.他是个好司机，虽然有点过于自信<br>

It is not asked without cause. A great deal of “The Crown”—even before you get to the ghastly<sup>/ˈɡɑːst.li/恐怖的</sup> prospect of a ghost—is manifest historical bunkum<sup>/ˈbʌŋkəm/废话；瞎话</sup>. Prince Philip did not, as was claimed in the second season, inadvertently<sup>/ˌɪnədˈvɜːtntli/经意地</sup> cause his sister to be killed in a plane crash (a fact that he found so offensive he reportedly considered suing). Prince Charles did not hint to the then prime minister, John Major, that Queen Elizabeth II ought to abdicate<sup>/ˈæbdɪkeɪt/退位</sup>. The short answer to the question of whether or not “The Crown” is history is clear: no. It is not.

The longer answer is more complicated. History might be problematic for “The Crown”, but it is also part of the appeal. Many viewers’ interest is not just in the drama but in its historical backdrop. People have found themselves fascinated by forgotten facts, including the finer details of the Suez<sup>苏伊士(埃及东北部港市，苏伊士省省会)</sup> crisis, the severity<sup> /sɪˈver.ɪ.ti/极为恶劣的</sup> of the Great Smog of 1952 and the (to many astounding) fact that the late queen had, once upon a time, been young.
>倫敦霧霾（英語：Great Smog of London、Great Smog of 1952）[3]是1952年12月5日至12月9日發生於英國倫敦的空氣污染事件。發生的原因包括氣溫低、反氣旋、無風以及大量燃燒煤炭所產生的空氣汙染而形成的大霧。

>雖然這是英國史上最嚴重的公害事件[4]，而且發生當時能見度極低，煙霧甚至影響到室內，但因倫敦在這之前已經歷過多次類似事件，所以當時並未引起重視。政府部門在數週後的報告中指出，截至12月8日，霧霾導致了計有四千人的死亡，並導致十萬人以上受到呼吸道疾病影響。2004年的報告更指出，估計有逾一萬兩千人死亡[5]。該事件使得政府修改了多項法規，包括1956年清潔空氣法，並且對於各國現代公害運動及環境運動的興起具有深遠的影響。原因是SOx（硫氧化物）嚴重超出正常值，與日本四日市哮喘的污染內容有共通之處。而反氣旋加劇的空氣品質惡化則類似1948年美國的多諾拉事件。

In its defence, “The Crown” does not claim to be history. On the contrary, as its new disclaimer explains, it is merely a “fictional dramatisation<sup>/ˌdræmətaɪˈzeɪʃn/(根据小说、历史事件等)改编成的剧本</sup>” that was “inspired by real events”. In doing so it is following in a grand dramatic tradition of playing fast and loose with the facts. Had Shakespeare had to slap a disclaimer on “Richard III” he would have had to opt for something stronger even than that, like “highly fictional dramatisation”, says Emma Smith, a professor of Shakespeare Studies at Oxford University.<sub>如果莎士比亚不得不在《理查三世》上加上免责声明，他甚至可能需要选择比那更强烈的措辞，比如‘高度虚构的戏剧化呈现’，这是牛津大学莎士比亚研究教授艾玛·史密斯（Emma Smith）的说法</sub> To get cross with “The Crown” for not being history is, on this reading, a simple category error: it never said it was.

>slap something on somebody/something<br>
>(informal) to order, especially in a sudden or an unfair way, that something must happen or somebody must do something强制实行；强迫某人做<br>
>The company slapped a ban on using email on the staff.公司对员工使用电子邮件发出禁令。<br>

Though it is not quite so simple as that. For one thing, the “is it history?” question assumes there is something that is “history” that is true and beyond reproach<sup>/rɪˈprəʊtʃ/</sup> and something separate and all made-up that is “drama”. In fact, there is “a porous<sup>/ˈpɔːrəs/not protected enough to stop people going through</sup> line between history and historical fiction”, says Dan Jones, a historian and author. Not for nothing was Herodotus<sup>[he'rɔdətəs]希罗多德(公元前5世纪古希腊历史学家, 被称为“历史之父”, 所著《历史》 [即《希腊波斯战争史》]系西方第一部历史著作)</sup>, “the father of history”, also called “the father of lies”. When the Greek historian Thucydides<sup> [θju:'sididi:z]修昔底德(约公元前460～约前400，古希腊历史学家)</sup> wanted to quote a speech whose text he did not have, he simply made it up and had “the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions”. History has a long and august history of blending fiction and truth.

Modern historians are more careful and do not—or should not—make things up. But it is foolish to imagine that sleight of hand and imagination are not involved in writing history. One of the most essential aspects of that art is also the least visible, namely what historians choose not to include. Leaving things out is essential: there is a lot of past out there. As the historian **Gregory of Tours**<sup>都尔的圣额我略（拉丁语：Sanctus Gregorius Turonensis，其名额我略也译作格雷戈里和国瑞，538年11月30日—594年11月17日）是都尔主教及高卢－罗马史学家，也是基督教圣人。他的本名为额我略·弗洛伦提乌斯（拉丁语：Gregorius Florentius）。[1]为了配合当时的教育程度他选择使用通俗拉丁文写作，他最有名的传世作品为共有10卷的《法兰克民族史》。 [3]该书是现存研究法兰克人早期历史最重要的史料之一</sup> glumly<sup>/ˈɡlʌmli/忧郁地</sup> observed: “A great many things keep happening, some of them good, some of them bad.” That was in the sixth century; a whole lot more has happened since then.

History is therefore as much about what is unwritten as what is written.<sub>因此，历史既关乎已写之事，也关乎未写之事</sub> The creator and writer of “The Crown”, Peter Morgan, has complained that he is criticised for what he included but not praised for what he tactfully<sup>/ˈtæktfəli/圆通的；得体的；不得罪人的</sup> omitted: “Speculation about paternity<sup>/pəˈtɜː.nɪ.ti/(事物的)起源；出处；来源；渊源
</sup>, affairs, this, that. It’s unbelievable, all we could have written.”

Moreover historical facts are tricky things. It is not necessary to endorse<sup>/ɪnˈdɔːs/（公开）赞同，支持，认可</sup> the “your truth” truthiness of Oprah Winfrey’s infamous interview with Meghan Markle to know that more than one historical narrative can be correct at the same time.<sub>不必赞同奥普拉·温弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey）与梅根·马克尔（Meghan Markle）的臭名昭著采访中的‘你的真相’的真实性，就可以知道多个历史叙述同时正确是可能的</sub> Just as a mountain might appear “to take on different shapes from different angles of vision”, so a simple historical “fact” can appear differently to different people, wrote the historian E.H. Carr. That does not mean that there are no facts but—as the royals themselves might say—“recollections<sup>往事；回忆的事</sup> may vary.” Newspaper fact-checks of the series (and there are many) often start by harrumphing<sup>/həˈrʌmfɪŋ/（表示不同意而）干咳</sup> but tail into ho-humming<sup>/ˌhəʊ ˈhʌm/[仿打呵欠声音而成, 表示厌倦、冷漠、困倦等]嗬-哼呣</sup>. So much is debatable.

History does not sit preserved from the pollution of fiction, like an insect in amber<sub>历史并非像琥珀中的昆虫那样，免受虚构的污染而保存不动</sub>. History and drama interact. There is, wrote Carr, a “two-way traffic between past and present”. When Edward VIII abdicated, Winston Churchill turned to Shakespeare’s Richard II to see how to draft the instrument of abdication; when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned, the man chosen to narrate the footage<sup>（影片中的）连续镜头，片段</sup> was not an august elder statesman but Laurence Olivier, an actor.<sub>“当爱德华八世退位时，温斯顿·丘吉尔转向莎士比亚的《理查二世》以了解如何起草退位仪式的文书；当伊丽莎白二世加冕时，被选为叙述镜头的人不是一位崇高的老政治家，而是演员劳伦斯·奥利维尔。”</sub> Those close to the royals admit that the family has watched “The Crown” and been affected by it. The series reportedly led the late queen to think about how she had treated her sister, Margaret.

The debate over whether or not “The Crown” is history or not might be fraught. It is also largely moot<sup>/muːt/（因不大可能发生而）无考虑意义的</sup>. To write history, as one philosopher observed, “is the only way of making it”. Historians might complain that Shakespeare’s “Richard III” is incorrect—or that “The Crown” is—but both have something more powerful than accuracy: popularity.

In Shakespeare’s day, people were already complaining that there were those who learn their history not from the chronicles but “from the play-books”. This series continues that tradition. “The Crown” might not be true history in the technical, academic sense of the term. However, that is immaterial. It will change how history is seen nonetheless. ■
